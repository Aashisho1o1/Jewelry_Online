# FonePay QR Code Setup Instructions

## What You Need to Do

1. **Save the QR Code Image:**
   - Take the FonePay QR code image you shared
   - Save it as `fonepay-qr-code.jpg` 
   - Place it in: `client/public/images/fonepay-qr-code.jpg`

2. **Verify the Setup:**
   - Go to your website
   - Add items to cart and go to checkout
   - Select "FonePay QR" payment method
   - Click "Place Order"
   - The modal should now show your real QR code!

## Technical Details (For Learning)

### Why This Approach Works:
- **Static Asset Serving**: Vite serves files from `client/public/` directly
- **Error Handling**: If image fails to load, shows fallback placeholder
- **Responsive Design**: QR code scales properly on mobile devices
- **Professional Look**: Matches your business branding

### File Structure:
```
client/public/images/
|-- fonepay-qr-code.jpg  <- Your QR code goes here
|-- hero-image.jpg
|-- esewa-logo.jpeg
`-- khalti-logo.png
```

### Security Considerations:
- QR code is static (safe to expose publicly)
- No sensitive payment data in the image
- Terminal ID is public information (safe to display)

## Next Steps After Setup

1. **Test the Payment Flow:**
   - Use a small test amount
   - Verify QR code scans properly
   - Check if Order ID appears in payment remarks

2. **Monitor Orders:**
   - Check your FonePay terminal for incoming payments
   - Match Order IDs with customer orders
   - Update order status manually for now

3. **Future Enhancements:**
   - Add webhook for automatic payment verification
   - Generate dynamic QR codes with order details
   - Add SMS notifications for successful payments

## Pro Tips

- **Image Quality**: Keep the QR code image clear and high-resolution
- **File Size**: Optimize image size (should be under 500KB)
- **Backup**: Keep a copy of the QR code image in a safe place
- **Testing**: Always test with small amounts first
